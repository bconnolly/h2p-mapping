# h2p-mapping
This repository began as a copy of [kumc-bmi/i2p-transform](https://github.com/kumc-bmi/i2p-transform), with the intention of splitting the KUMC specific mapping of the HERON i2b2 ontology onto the [PCORNet i2b2 ontology](https://github.com/SCILHS/scilhs-ontology) from the more generalizable [kumc-bmi/i2p-transform](https://github.com/kumc-bmi/i2p-transform).
